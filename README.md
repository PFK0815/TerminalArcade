# TerminalArcade
Here are games avaiable for my TerminalArcade games.<br />

# Note
Just download the the downloader.
Then use it, it can install all other games based on your platform automatically.<br />
For bugs/errors ingame or with the downloader, contact me at GitHub.<br />
That's not an virus!: At my windows 10 laptop, Avast antivirus alerted detected with Cybercapture. I think it is because the downloader downloads other files.<br />
That's not an virus!: Sure pack or run the JavaScript file yourself, that will work too.

# 100% code is from me!
I did at first just the game. But then i think, i make my game series!<br />
